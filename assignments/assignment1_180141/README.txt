The definitions of integration functions are in the 'integral.h' file.

The problem statement of the assignment is solved in the file 'asgn1.cpp'.

To compile program, type the following in your terminal;
    $ cd [path to where code is saved]
    $ g++ asgn1.cpp -o asgn1
    $ ./asgn1

OR, to run the executable file only;
    $ cd [path to where code is saved]
    $ ./asgn1

The code has been tested to be functioning on the mathserver.iitk.ac.in computer.
