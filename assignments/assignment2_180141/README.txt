The definitions of matrix functions are in the 'matrix.h' file.

The problem statement of the assignment is solved in the file 'asgn2.cpp'.

To compile program, type the following in your terminal;
    $ cd [path to where code is saved]
    $ g++ -std=c++11 asgn2.cpp -o asgn2     ## to set g++ compiler standard to C++11
    $ ./asgn2

OR, to run the executable file only;
    $ cd [path to where code is saved]
    $ ./asgn2

The code has been tested to be functioning on the mathserver.iitk.ac.in computer with above commands.
